        <h1>Privacy Policy for CV Builder</h1>
        <pre>
**Last Updated:** June 16, 2025

Yahia Hosny ("us", "we", or "our") operates the CV Builder desktop application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service.

This is a desktop application. All your data is processed and stored locally on your machine. We do not have a server, and we do not collect or store your personal information remotely.

**1. Information Collection and Use**

To provide the Service, the application requires access to and processes several types of information on your local device:

* **Personal and Professional Data:** The content of the CV file (.pdf or .txt) you provide, which may include your name, contact details, work history, and education.
* **API Keys:** Your personal API keys for Google Gemini and Canva. These are stored locally on your machine by the application for the sole purpose of connecting to these third-party services on your behalf. **Your API keys are never transmitted to us or any other third party besides the intended service (Google and Canva).**
* **Application Data:** URLs for job descriptions and your GitHub profile that you provide for processing.

**2. How Your Information Is Used**

Your information is used exclusively to:
* Provide the core functionality of the Service, which is to generate tailored job application documents.
* Send your CV content and job description data to the Google Gemini API to generate text.
* Send the AI-generated text and your template information to the Canva API to create styled documents.
* Scrape public data from job description URLs and the GitHub URL you provide.

**3. Data Sharing and Third-Party Disclosure**

The application shares your data with third-party services only when necessary to provide its features.
* **Google Gemini API:** We send your CV text and the scraped job description text to Google's API. Your use is subject to Google's Privacy Policy.
* **Canva API:** We send the AI-generated text and your chosen template ID to Canva's API. Your use is subject to Canva's Privacy Policy.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.

**4. Data Security**
The security of your data depends on the security of the local machine where you run the application. You are solely responsible for securing your computer and your API keys.

**5. Contact Us**
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: la601004@gmail.com
